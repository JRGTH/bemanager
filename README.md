bemanager
=========

FreeBSD utility to manage, backup, and restore Boot Environments on ZFS filesystems from an easy to use Text User Interface(TUI), bemanager is actually a wrapper around the well known FreeBSD beadm utility.

The utility also uses the default zfs send/receive commands for BE/Snap replication and restoration to/from either local or remote storage with XZ compression but is not limited to.

Please note that I'm not a programmer by trade, also this utility is not intended to be a replacement for the command line, but for the ease of some common task on demand.
